# CHANS-HiPIMS-FLAMEGPU
The HiPIMS-FLAMEGPU Coupled Model Framework integrates the high-performance hydrodynamic modeling capabilities of HiPIMS with the flexible agent-based modeling environment of FLAMEGPU. This combined framework allows for the simulation of complex interactions between human activities and flooding processes.
